Connecticut is full of good attorneys.
What sets me apart from my competition is the diversity of my practice areas and the depth of my knowledge base.
Most uniquely, however, is that once retained, I will not give-up on you. 
I will strive to win your case or settle it the way you want.

The legal system presents a number of challenges for lay persons but I have been around for
a while so I know how to get things done. 
I will try to handle your case as quickly and painlessly as possible. 
I know you want to get on with your life or respective business interests.

The facts of your case matter to me. 
Professionally meeting your legal needs is my number one goal every day. 
I care about you while handling your divorce, keeping a family member out of jail, 
listening when you have been wrongly discharged from your employer or helping negotiate a 
favorable settlement.  Simply stated, I care about you.

 


 

//This shit is fluff and needs to disappear.

To those of you that I have had the great fortune to represent, I say, “thank you. 
I am glad I was able to help you.”  Representing each of you, over the years, 
has been a great honor.


To new clients, I say, "Welcome!"  
Call for an appointment so we can talk about your case.  
Let me know how I can help you!
