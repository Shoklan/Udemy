	<!-- Description
		========================================================== -->
		<div class="container" id="descript">
		<div class="cols-sm-8 botMargin topMargin" id="descript"><p>Connecticut is full of good attorneys.  What sets me apart from my competition is the diversity of my practice areas and 	the depth of my knowledge 
			base.  Most uniquely, however, is that once retained, I will not give-up on you.  I will strive to win your case or settle it the way you want.
			The legal system presents a number of challenges for lay persons but I have been around for a while so I know how to get things done.  I will try to handle your case as quickly and 
			painlessly as possible.  I know you want to get on with your life or respective business interests.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="cols-sm-8 botMargin" id="descript"><p>The facts of your case matter to me.  Professionally meeting your legal needs is my number one goal every day.   I care 
			about you while handling your divorce, keeping a family member
			out of jail, listening when you have been wrongly discharged from your employer or helping negotiate a favorable settlement.  Simply stated, I care about you.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="cols-sm-8 botMargin" id="descript"><p>To those of you that I have had the great fortune to represent, I say, “thank you.  I am glad I was able to help you.”  Representing each of you, over the years, has been a great 
			honor.</p>
