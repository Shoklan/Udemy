- Data is broken into two types: Dimensions and Measures.
- Numericals in Measures; Dimensions are categorical. // Default
- `ALT + SHFT + BACKSPACE` to clear the whole dashboard of all elements.
- To create *Calculated* fields, `Right CLK Measures > Create Calculatd Field`.

- You can add colos by drag and droping the element onto the Color Inserts.
- Ease of understanding is the focus; don't forget this.
- You can add textual informatino using the Label Insert.

- Tableau Public does not allow one to export images. // $1k license: ouch.

- Extract button changes Tableau from using a live connection to a copy of the data.
- I cannot find this is Tableau 10 anywhere.

- How does Tableau know what level of aggregation you want?
- Tableau will always aggregate measure of the level of the granularity of your worksheet.
- You can "highlight" data from the set by simply selecting the category in the alternative box.
- This software is totally worth $1000.
- Add "Filters" by going to `Right Click Filter Dimension > Show Filter` .

- This can cause duplicate rows to exist.
- .. Creates heirarchies to manage geolocation data.
- .. will sometimes auto-create the data for you.

- To modify the visualization for users, you use Filters and Actions.
- Filters divide the data into subsets; highlights select only relevant data.

- Joins are operations that are performed on relational databases.
- Data Blending is controversial?
- Data Blending allows you to combine data "on the fly."

- Links are dynamically created based upon Dimension names.
- Blending can be done using multiple columns/Dimensions.
- Subtracting an Aggregated field from a non-aggregated field will create errors.
