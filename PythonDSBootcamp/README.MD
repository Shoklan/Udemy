# Recommender Systems
- The two most common types of **Recommendar Systems** are:
  1. Content Based.
  2. Collaborative Filtering
- In the real world, *Collaborative Filtering* is what gets used.
- It can also be split into two subcategories:
  1. Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering.
  2. Model-Based Collaborate Filtering.
- There wont be a lecture walk through for the Advanced notebook due to the mathematical requirements.
- Walkthrough via video is not good for notes.
