# The Ultimate Hands-On Hadoop - Tame Your Big Data
## Frank Kane

# Learn all The Buzzwords and Install Hadoop
- Install Oracle Virtualbox.
- Download an image:
  * Cloudera
  * Hortonworks.
- We'll be using Hortonworks in this course.
- The downloaded file should be an *.ova* which you can simple click on to import the settings.
- Once it is imported, simply start it.
- We will be using the data from movielens.org .
- We'll be using the 100k dataset.
- You can navigate to the UI by typing `127.0.0.1:8888` into your browser and with the image running.
- The username/password is maria_dev/maria_dev.
- You will import the data using the Hive View.
- You can keep the CSV option and just replace the delimiter.
- Name the columns of the uploaded file.
- Then, select *Upload Table*.
- The *Visualization* tabular allows one to create quick and useful visualizations of the data.
- **Hadoop** is an open source software platform for distributed storage and distribution processing of very large data sets on computer clusters built from commodity hardware.
- Data is too big to be handled by a single computer.
- Vertical scaling no longer can handle the problems being dealt with.
- Horizontal Scaling is linear.
- Hadoop is for more than just batch processing anymore.
- Hadoop Technologies:
  * Hadoop Distributed File System: HDFS.
  * Yet Another Resource Negotiator: YARN.
  * MapReduce.
  * Pig: [High Level Programming API]
  * Hive: [SQL query schema builder]
  * Apache Ambari: [ Overview of the full system]
  * Mesos: [Sort of a Resource Negotiator]
  * Spark: [\*/10]
  * Tez: [ Query Optimizer ]
  * Apache HBase: [ NoSQL database ]
  * Apache Storm: [ Processing Streaming Data ]
  * Oozie: [ Task Scheduler Grouper ]
  * Zookeeper: [ Coordinating Clusters ]
  * Sqoop: [SQL Connector ]
  * Flume: [ Transforming Weblogs ]
  * Kafka: [Signal Processor ]
  * MYSQL
  * Cassandra
  * MongoDB
  * Apache Drill
  * Apache Phoenix
  * Presto
  * Apache Zepplin
  * HUE
