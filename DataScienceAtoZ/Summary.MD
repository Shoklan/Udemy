# Data Science A-Z

## Introduction
- Course by Kirill Eremenko

- 4 Parts to the Course
	1. Tableau
	2. Modeling
	3. Data Preparation
	4. Communication

### Why Is Data Science the Profession of the Future?
- The rate at which data is being created is exponential - and we need to find a way to deal with it.
- IDC Digital Universe Study?
- Machines cannot store nor compute the data we're creating.
- You can make mega 'uge amounts of $$.

- Domains:
	1. Computer Science
	2. Math/Statistics
	3. Domain Knowledge
- This problem has only gotten worse; need more skills:
	1. Statistics.
	2. Visualizations
	3. Data Mining.
	4. Databases & Data Process.
	5. Neurocomputing?
	6. Machine Learning.
	7. Pattern Recognition.

- Even this is not enough:
	1. Communication.
	2. Presentation.
	3. Domain Knowledge.
	4. Real-Life Practice.
	5. Programming.
	6. Creativity.

- Covering most topics in 21 hours of content?

## Tableau
- Tableau is drag and drop.
- Tableau Public is free, but requires all code to be open.
- [Course Public Files](http://www.superdatascience.com/training)
- Open a .CSV file `Left Side > Text File > Select File`
- If you add more than one file, Tableau will try to join them.

- Dimensions are Independant Variables; Measures are Dependant Variables.

Going to be really hard to translate visual data into textual data.

### Problem: Who gets a bonus?
- Kirill is correct; UI is amazingly intuitive.
- You can use `Right Click > Calculated Fields` to create new variables in Tableau
- Dragging a variable onto marks will allow you apply that mark to the variable and it will be added.
- If you `CTRL + drag` the variable onto the mark, that will work too.
- "Tableau has the capacity to make visualizations, but also to make them reasy to understand."
- If you `Right CLK Worksheet > Copy > Image` then you can export the image; only if paid version though.

- Type can be changed on a 'Dimension' using `Right CLK`.
- Tableau is AMAZING at dealing with geo data.
