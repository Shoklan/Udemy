# The Ultimate Drawing Course - Beginner to Advanced
##


# Getting Started With the Course
- Make sure that you're actually practicing and doing the lessons.
- **Lines** are the fundamental of all drawing.
- They also gives perspective from the direction on the line.
- They can also create the expected motion of characters.
- **Shapes** are the next fundamental.
- There are four of them:
  1. Square.
  2. Circle.
  3. Triangle.
  4. Trapezoid
- The next fundamental is **Form** - which is the 3 dimensional part of drawing.
- While some shapes can give dimension on their own, some - like a sphere - would just look like a circle without shadow.
- The next is **Value** which is how light or dark something is.
- The last fundamental is **Perspective** which will really imbue your art with reality.
- You can use any paper or pencils for drawing but getting a sketchbook is probably best.
- Animators tend to draw with blue colored pencils.
- While you might think you don't need it, you really need a ruler for straight lines.
- Drawing is important because it is the building block of all art.
- Studios will take you for work if you can draw.
- It is also an easy - if not the easiest - way to convey and idea.
