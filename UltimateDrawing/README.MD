# The Ultimate Drawing Course - Beginner to Advanced
##


# Getting Started With the Course
- Make sure that you're actually practicing and doing the lessons.
- **Lines** are the fundamental of all drawing.
- They also gives perspective from the direction on the line.
- They can also create the expected motion of characters.
- **Shapes** are the next fundamental.
- There are four of them:
  1. Square.
  2. Circle.
  3. Triangle.
  4. Trapezoid
- The next fundamental is **Form** - which is the 3 dimensional part of drawing.
- While some shapes can give dimension on their own, some - like a sphere - would just look like a circle without shadow.
- The next is **Value** which is how light or dark something is.
- The last fundamental is **Perspective** which will really imbue your art with reality.
- You can use any paper or pencils for drawing but getting a sketchbook is probably best.
- Animators tend to draw with blue colored pencils.
- While you might think you don't need it, you really need a ruler for straight lines.
- Drawing is important because it is the building block of all art.
- Studios will take you for work if you can draw.
- It is also an easy - if not the easiest - way to convey and idea.


# Learn How to Draw a Realistic Eye
- You always want to start on the base before you worry about the details, otherwise they wont look good either.
- As you get towards the end of the drawing, you'll be able to darken the lines, but you'll want them to be light at the beginning.
- Make sure that your pencil is always sharp.
- The more contrast, the better your artwork will look.
- Drawing is about going over the drawing again and again, adding more detail as you go.

# Learning Line Fundamentals
- Now we'll talk about lines.
- There are lots of different kinds of lines.
- A **Contour Lines** are the lines that make up an image.
- While drawing them, you'll want to consider the thickness or thinness of the lines: called **Line Quality**.
- One of the biggest tips for making excellent art is a heavy emphasis on Contrast everywhere.
- Another way to sharpen your art skills is copying objects.
- People tend to make the common mistake of looking at their drawing too much and the object not enough.
- Eventually, you will be drawing out of your head but you'll want to work with real objects before that.
- **Cross Contour Lines** are lines used to create inside values of shapes.
- Instead of making contour lines straight, they should follow the form of the object.

# Learning Shape and Form Form Fundamentals
- *Shapes* are the second most important aspect of drawing.
- There are two kinds of shapes: **Orgranic** and **Geometric**.
- Geometric are exactly what you would think.
- An **Organic Shape** would be something without a well defined mathematical representation.
- From Geometric shapes, you create organic shapes; use the geometric shapes as a guide.
- **Negative Space** is the area where there is nothing from your shapes.
- They are very important since they help define the artwork.


# Learning Values and Contrast
- **Space** is just the illusion of creating 3D objects in 2D space.
- **Overlapping** is when you appear to draw objects in front of or behind others.
- **Size** is when we draw objects scaled in such a way to represent proportional distance.
- **Placement** is using the location in the frame to imply distance.
- **Detail** is when you add more details to an object to imply they are closer in frame.
- **Value** is when you use the change in value to imply distance.
- **Perspective** is lines you use to guide how far away something is.


# Learning Space and Perspective

- The further away things are, the lighter then tend to be.
- **One Point Perspective** is where we use one point to build the perspective.
-  This point is the vanishing point of the picture.
- Normally, you will want to modify your horizon line so that it is not straight.
- **Two-Point Perspective** is when there are two vanishing points instead of just one.
- The **Rule of 60%** is that you can only show 60% of what is inside your horizon line.
