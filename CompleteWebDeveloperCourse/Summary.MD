- It's good convention to have a DOCTYPE to make it easier to parse for Web browsers.
- Anything in french braces is called a **tag**.
- Anything with `< >` is an opening tag

- The first part of a webpage is the head.
- The head contains supporting information - such as source files.

- **Title** tag is what shows up for the browser window title.
- **Meta** tag is for describing the webpage itself.

- **Body** tag is where all the content is.
- **Div** stands for divisions of the page.
- **H#** is for headers of sections of a page.
- **P** is short for paragraph.
- **A** is an anchor to another page.

- Proper nomenclature means that there should only be one H1 tag.
- Html ignores line breaks and redundant spaces.
- You should use `<br />`; even if it's not enforced.
- Use `<hr />` for Horizontal Rules.
- Don't use `<strong>` for anything, ever. You'll want to use CSS for this.
- Don't use `<em>` for anything, ever.     You'll want to use CSS for this.
- Don't use `<u>` for anything, ever.      You'll want to use CSS for this.
- Don't use `<strike>` for anything, ever. You'll want to use CSS for this.

- Use `<ul>` for unordered lists.
- Use `<li>` for list items.
- Use `<ol>` for ordered lists.
- To insert imagees, use `<img src=[path_to_file] />`.
- To adjust the dimensions of an image, use the attributes `height=` and `weight=`.
- **Form** is used for creating interactable content.
- **Input** is for user input; self-closing.
	1. `type="text"` //
		i. `value="example"` // Use placeholder instead.
		ii. `placeholder="delete me"`.
	2. `type="email"`
	3. `type="radio"`
		i. To group them, use `name= "grouping"`.
	4. `type="checkbox"`
	5. `type="submit"`
		i. To set the button name, use `value="Click Me"`.
		ii. Use `name="submit"` to identify this item.
		iii. There is now a `<submit>` now in HTML5.

- **Textarea** is for a larger comment block; needs to be closed.
- **Placeholder** should work for textarea.
- **Select** for dropdown boxes.
- **Option** is nested in **select** for possible choices; needs to be closed.
- Items must have names to submit the values entered to the backend.

- To create a table, use `<table>`.
- All tables contain table rows defined as `<tr>`.
- Define headers in the table using `<th>`.
- Inside table rows are table data using `<td>`.

- HTML entities are characters that are used to mark up documents; therefore it requires meta characters to represent them.
- FRAMES ARE EVIL; ONLY USE AS A LAST RESORT.
- Create a frame using `<iframe src="source_file_or_page" ></iframe>
