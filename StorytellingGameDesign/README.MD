# What is a Game?
- As Humans, telling stories is something we instinctively do.
- When a story is a passive medium - such as books, magazines - then the medium is under authorial control.
- Games are more active experiences - which is what makes them different.
- It is the player who navigates through the game.
- **Games** are interactive digital entertainment played on a computer, games console or other device.
- The lecturer's definition is:
> A Video game is a problem-solving activity, approached with a playful attitude, that is interacted with via a computer.

- It is separated from other mediums by interaction and choice.
- Players can create their own stories and variety of experiences.
- Principly, it is the set of possibilities laid out by the Story creator.
- Many games wont sit in a single category.
- **Game Mechanics** are the rules or methods designed for interaction with the game state thus providing gameplay.
- The less profound answer to why games have a story is that making them costs money and you should do it right from the start.
- The more profound answer is that story means purpose or meaning.
- **The Story is what makes the game make sense.**

> The player decides what to eat; the writer designs the menu.


# Storytelling - The Basics
- You can use **Story Lite** vs **Story Rich** as a tool to decide what the story elements should look like.
- It could be a backdrop and not much else.
- The **Storyworld** is the entirety of hte world in which your story takes place.

- Questions?:
  1. What is interesting about the world?
  2. What are its rules?
  3. What does the society look like?
  4. what is the place and time?
  5. How did this world begin?
  6. What has shaped this world?
  7. What are the beliefs?
  8. What does nature look like here?
- The **Story** is all events that occur.
- The **Plot** is how and why these events are happening.
- The **Narrative** is how the story and plot are conveyed to the player.
- A *Story* must have a beginning, a middle and an end.
- Just as important as what the player is trying to achieve is what is in conflict with the player.
- What are the stakes for the Antagonist?
- Beware that the stake are not too big and too abstract.
- Often, a human element is what makes the story resonate.
- Equally important is the idea of **Escalation**.
- There needs to be a sense of evolution as you move through the game.

# Start with an Idea!
- Sometimes ideas are disjointed and you'll have to flesh them out.
> There are no bad ideas.

- // **Incorrect**.
> Bad games are not usually a bad idea but a poorly developed idea.

- There is no one way to generate ideas.
- What are you responsible for in the game?
- Ideas often start with "What if?" or "Wouldn't it be cool if?".
- The whole point of being a story teller is to share them.
- You need to be able to communicate your game idea to others in order to get them interested.
- It can be a great exercise to explain your idea in a couple sentences or a paragraph.
- It can be useful to check out other games that are similar in idea.
