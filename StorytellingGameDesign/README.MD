# What is a Game?
- As Humans, telling stories is something we instinctively do.
- When a story is a passive medium - such as books, magazines - then the medium is under authorial control.
- Games are more active experiences - which is what makes them different.
- It is the player who navigates through the game.
- **Games** are interactive digital entertainment played on a computer, games console or other device.
- The lecterer's definition is:
> A Video game is a problem-solving activitiy, approached with a playful attitude, that is interacted with via a computer.

- It is separated from other mediums by interaction and choice.
- Players can create their own stories and variety of experiences.
- Principly, it is the set of possibilities laid out by the Story creator.
- Many games wont sit in a single category.
- **Game Mechanics** are the rules or methods designed for interaction with the game state thus providing gameplay.
- The less prfound answer to why games have a story is that making them costs money and you should do it right from the start.
- The more profound answer is that story means purpose or meaning.
- **The Story is what makes the game make sense.**
